The "pass" statement
********************

   pass_stmt ::= "pass"

"pass" is a null operation --- when it is executed, nothing happens.
It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required
syntactically, but no code needs to be executed, for example:

   def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

   class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)
